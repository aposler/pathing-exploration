## Alex Osler | Data Visualization | Pathing Algirhtm Exploration
This was all done by Alex Osler

Project is here https://a4-aposler.herokuapp.com/

The project is allow the user to explore 4 different pathing algorithms,
A*, Breadth First, Depth First, and Greedy Best First. Each is simply
performed on a 2d plane, and the user able to create obstacles in the 
way of each algorithm by dragging on the HTML canvas. The user can see
all nodes explored by each algorithm, and can control the speed of them,
including pausing and stepping through the algorithm. The grid also has a
customizable size, between 2 and 50. Finally, the created grid can be saved
to a sqlite database, with a custom grid and username. If a user wants to load
the grid they can see all grids tied to a given username by entering the username,
and they can then load any of the grids.
